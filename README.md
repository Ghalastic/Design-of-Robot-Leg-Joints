# The Robot's Leg Joints

## A Design of the Robot's lower body parts - Leg Joints (hips, knees, ankles)

### Process of Thought Behind the Design - The Vision:
Before drawing the leg joints, I aimed for a design that balanced strength and flexibility. I started with cylindrical joints for smooth rotational movement and designed the base components to be sturdy for support. I chose robust materials for the base and lighter ones for the upper joints. Ensuring that each part fit together seamlessly was crucial, so I carefully refined the dimensions and angles. My vision was to create an efficient and visually coherent mechanism, with each component working together to enable the desired motion.
